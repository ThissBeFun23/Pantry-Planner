# Pantry-Planner
Have an idea that could make our app even better? We want to hear it.
We built this app for people who love to cook, and we know the best ideas don't always come from inside a development team — they come from you, the people actually using it every day. Maybe you've thought of a feature that would save you time in the kitchen. Maybe something isn't working quite the way you'd expect. Maybe you just want to tell us what you love so we can do more of it.
Whatever it is, your feedback shapes what we build next. Every suggestion gets read, every piece of criticism helps us improve, and every conversation brings us closer to the cooking companion you actually want.
And if you're a developer, designer, or just someone who loves tinkering — we'd love to collaborate. Whether it's a pull request, a mockup, or just a napkin sketch of how something could work better, there's a seat at the table for you.
This app belongs to its community as much as it belongs to us. So don't be shy — reach out, share your thoughts, and help us cook up something great together.
